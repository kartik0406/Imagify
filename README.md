# Imagify
A web app for Static Visual Media Cryptography based on Rubix’s Cube Principle

- In the past few years, several encryption algorithms based on chaotic systems have been proposed as means to protect digital images against cryptographic attacks. These encryption algorithms typically use relatively small key spaces and thus offer limited security, especially if they are one-dimensional. In this paper, we proposed a novel image encryption algorithm based on Rubik's cube principle. The original image is scrambled using the principle of Rubik's cube. Then, XOR operator is applied to rows and columns of the scrambled image using two secret keys. Finally, the experimental results and security analysis show that the proposed image encryption scheme not only can achieve good encryption and perfect hiding ability but also can resist exhaustive attack, statistical attack, and differential attack.

- We aim to implement the digital image cryptography based on Rubix’s Cube Principle and also to develop a website or UI interface for encrypting and decrypting the image using the proposed algorithm which can be used very conveniently to secure static visual data.
This project  will have an impact to increase image security and  solve issues related to image copying and digital image privacy protection, its watermarking and can resist exhaustive attack, statistical attack and differential attack.
